# Jewish-Populations-Across-Time
I wanted to share this project that I worked on for data visualization. I’m history teacher, so I’m always looking for ways to use data analytics in the humanities and social studies!

# OVERVIEW:
This project focuses on using Python to explore and analyze global Jewish population data, with the goal of answering the following questions:

How do Jewish population shares compare across countries and across world regions in each benchmark year?
Which countries experienced the largest percentage decline from 1931 to 1948 (a pre–post World War II benchmark in this dataset)?
Which countries experienced the largest percentage growth from 1948 to 2023?
For this dataset, we have population data from the following years:

* 1899
* 1931
* 1948
* 1992
* 2023
  
# SOURCE OF DATA
I got the data from the Echoes and Reflections website.

# TOOLS USED
Cleaned data and visualized using pandas, matplotlib, and seaport.

CHALLENGES
There were many countries with missing data because they didn't exist as official entities at certain times.
